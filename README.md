# ELAsTiCC
Repo for settings, config, metrics for DESC's Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge.  More information can be found on the ELAsTiCC web page at: https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/lsst/DESC_TD_PUBLIC/ELASTICC/

Much of the code supporting the ELAsTiCC and (especially) ELAsTiCC2 campaigns can be found in the repo for the [DESC TOM][https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tom_desc/].  Some of the code here is out of date (was used for ELAsTiCC, not ELAsTiCC2).

## Taxonomy
Code to generate an illustration of the extendable taxonomy lives in the taxonomy subdirectory, in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/elasticc/blob/main/taxonomy/taxonomy.ipynb)

## Metrics
ELAsTiCC metrics have their own github repository: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/elasticc_metrics/
